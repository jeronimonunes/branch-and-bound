<div id="instructions">
  <p>This page aims to provide an easy to understand visualization of Branch and Bound algorithm</p>
  <p>The linear programming will be calculated using the <a href="https://jeronimonunes.github.io/simplex-web/">Simplex</a> and then new restrictions are going to be added to make the result integer</p>
  <p>All the calculations are done within your browser page, so, if you close the app while the calculations are
    running, you will loose the progress.</p>
  <p>Down below you may write your Linear Program, use the example as a basis to understand the sintax.
    Simple mathematical expressions like *, +, -, /, are going to be interpreted before running simplex.
